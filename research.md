  <p><strong>Abstract.</strong> This study investigates the economic impact of climate change on fisheries by providing the first causal estimate of the effect of sea surface temperatures (SST) variations on fishing revenues. We formalize this relationship within a theoretical model and estimate it empirically using over 2.5 million spatially disaggregated observations of fishing revenues from European vessels (2013–2022), matched with satellite-based SST data. The identification strategy leverages a novel exposure metric, Marine Degree Days, which quantifies species-specific temperature exposure relative to biologically established thermal tolerance intervals. Within this framework we address key identification challenges unique to the fisheries context, including non-random spatial selection by fishers and ecological interdependencies across species. We find that deviations from species’ thermal preferences, whether colder or warmer, lead to significant losses in fishing revenues, with hot exposure causing the most pronounced impacts. These effects are mediated by species’ typical depth ranges, and ecological category. Projections across different climate scenarios point to widespread revenues declines by 2100, reaching 800 million of annual losses in the worst scenario, though impacts vary considerably by region. Lower-income, equatorial areas are expected to suffer the most, while some colder regions may see modest gains. Taken together, our findings reveal the asymmetric and non-linear effects of ocean warming on fisheries, reinforcing the urgent need for adaptive strategies to support marine-based livelihoods.</p>

    <strong> Site aggregation in recreational demand modelling with an application to the impact of sediments runoffs in coastal waters </strong><br/>

  <p><strong>Abstract.</strong> This paper estimates the impact of site aggregation in multisite travel cost models, considering two different estimators: the repeated conditional logit and the two-stage approach. Using data from more than 9000 choice-occasions across 176 recreational sites, we evaluate whether grouping all non-target site alternatives into a single “other recreation’’ option affects parameters estimates and welfare values. We find that that aggregation has negligible effects on both coefficients and welfare measures. The two-stage approach performs similarly to the conditional logit when simulating site-closure scenarios, but it becomes substantially less precise in applications involving changes in site quality. Our findings highlight the value of comparing both estimators in applied work and suggest that grouping together alternatives that play only a limited role in the substitution patterns of interests can be a defensible and practical modelling choice. Our empirical application concerns beach closures triggered by sediments runoffs on Maui, Hawaiʻi, estimated to generate welfare losses in ranging from $6 to $11 million, depending on the modelling assumptions.</p>

    <strong> Dispersion-induced status quo bias in pivot-designed Choice Experiment </strong><br/>

  </summary>

  <p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Two drivers of the status quo bias are explored via a split sample survey with a pivot-designed Discrete Choice Experiment interviewing recreational fishers in Italy. The propensity to favor the status quo over the hypothetical alternatives given an individual reference point, which we call “dispersion” is examined and modelled accordingly. The framing of the status quo alternative, as a driver of bias, is explored as reference point or opt-out option. Our findings demonstrate that when the status quo is characterized as an individual-specific reference, the status quo bias increases with the magnitude of the dispersion, leading to potentially biased willingness-to-pay estimates. Conversely, when the status quo is characterized as an opt-out option, the effect of the dispersion diminishes, improving the robustness of the estimates. Our results underscore the importance of carefully designing choice scenarios to manage status quo bias. In order to improve the accuracy of welfare estimates, a novel random utility model that tests and accounts for the effects of dispersion is proposed. The performance of this model is numerically tested in a series of Monte Carlo experiments.</p>

  <summary>
    <strong>Conservation against Local Growth? Assessing the Economic Consequences of Marine Protection</strong><br/>
    <span>
      with Clementina Crocè, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/carlofezzi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlo Fezzi</a>, and Rosario Guaia
    </span>
  </summary>
  <p><strong>Description.</strong> This project aim to provide a causal assessment of how Marine Protected Areas affect local economic performance. We combine the staggered rollout of MPAs in Italy with administrative firm balance-sheet data for coastal municipalities to estimate how protection reshapes revenues and sectoral activity in nearby communities.</p>

    <strong>Burning Minds: Unpacking the Impact of Extreme Heat and Pollution on Mental Health</strong><br/>
    <span>
      with  <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/andrea-berlanda/home-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrea Berlanda</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/elilodigiani/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elisabetta Lodigiani</a>, Elisa Tosetti, and Giorgio Vittadini
    </span>
  </summary>
  <p><strong>Description.</strong> This project studies how extreme heat affects severe mental-health outcomes and whether air pollution (especially PM2.5) amplifies these effects. Using the universe of healthcare data (such as hospitalization and drug prescriprion) for the italian region of Lombardy matched with high-frequency climate and air-quality data, we aim to identify the causal effect of temperature and air pollution on different mental health outcomes.</p>

  </summary>
  <p><strong>Description.</strong> This project studies how drip irrigation affects farm productivity and water efficiency using detailed panel data from Italian apple and grape producers. The goal is to understand whether more efficient irrigation technologies can reduce agricultural water use without harming farm economic performance.</p>
