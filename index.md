I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Applied Environmental and Energy Economics Lab (A3EL)](https://sites.google.com/view/a3el/home) at the University of Trento.

I earned my PhD from the University of Trento in 2025. During my doctoral studies, I visited the EmLab in Santa Barbara (CA) and the Choice Modelling Center in Leeds (UK). 

I am an environmental and resource economist. My econometric toolkit is broad, ranging from advanced choice modelling to causal inference, and including more specialized approaches such as generalized additive models.

Thanks for visiting!
